Natural language to SQL Query for Retail Database

This project creates a chatbot that understands everyday language and turns it into SQL queries using GPT-4o mini! This guide shows you how to build a chatbot that can understand questions asked in normal language, create the right SQL commands, and get answers from a SQL database. Itâ€™s easy to use and works through a simple interface made with Streamlit.
